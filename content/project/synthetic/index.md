title: "Synthetic -- Symbolic Generators of Complex Networks"
summary: "A machine learning tool that can be used to discover plausible generators for complex networks. Generators are simple computer programs that control the growth of a network from the bottom-up, in a similar fashion to the processes believed to underlie the emergence of many different types of networks, be them biological, social or technological."
