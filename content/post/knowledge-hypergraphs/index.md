Hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs (mathematical objects that represent networks), that allow for the representation of complex information structures, namely human knowledge and natural language communication. By employing modern Natural Language Processing techniques and general knowledge ontologies and databases, it becomes possible to transform free-form text into formal structures that are convenient both for AI and Social Sciences research.

The [Graphbrain](http://graphbrain.net) open-source research tool is being developed with the aim of both aiding in the research project, and making the techniques available to the scientific community.
